			<p>
				Player Rank is the weighted average of a player's
				<a wicket:id="TeamRankPage2">Team Ranks</a>.
				Ranks are weighted by the number of opponent teams defeated by each team you played on.
				To be precise, Player Rank = sum((team rank) * (team victories)) / (total team victories).
			</p>
			<p>
				The original
				<a wicket:id="LeaderBoardPage">Leader Board</a>
				is still available, although I consider the
				Elo ranking to be a
				better measurement of player skill as it takes into
				consideration the
				skill level of the players
				you beat.
