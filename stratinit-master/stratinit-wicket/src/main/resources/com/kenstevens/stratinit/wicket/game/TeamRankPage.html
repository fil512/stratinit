				Team Rank is calculated using the
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo Ranking System</a>
				with
				a starting rank of 1500, an algorithm of 400 and a K-factor of 32.  For each game,
				an ELO is recalculated for all (winner, loser) pairs.  So if there is a game with
				4 teams, then the ELO would be recalculated 3 times, adding to the winning team's rank
				3 times, and subtracting from each of the losing teams' rank once.
