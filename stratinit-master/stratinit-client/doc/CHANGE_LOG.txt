Release 1.1.48 interim
  * Setting move order on unit with 0 mob now draws black line
  * Building new city now updates map
  * Added supply unit list to Supply tab
  * Show both my relation and their relation on player tab
  * Allow next build for BASE (which makes sense when switch on tech gain is checked)
  * Added configurable option (default on) that scrolls the map when you select a land or water square (thanks SuperNovaSS)
  * Fixed a couple of minor NullPointer bugs that crashed the client every now and then

Release 1.1.48
  * Fixed error that occurred when building a city.
  * Fixed missing black line when setting move order on unit.
  * Improved error logging.  Now when there's an error, the user will be told an error number.  This
    number will be logged in the database along with the details of the error so they can be cross-referenced
    later.

Release 1.1.47

Release 1.1.46
  * The Support tab now helps you manage support across the entire map--displaying overlapping support
    and supply lines of your ports and supply ships.
  * City Waypoint is now cleared when you capture a city and when the type of unit being built in the city changes.
  * Ported to Linux with a tremendous amount of help from Barry Peddycord.  Thank you kind sir!!!
  * Changed event model in client.  This should make the client faster and less glitchy, but
    some stuff in the client might not update properly while I work out the kinks of the new event model.

Release 1.1.45
  * Fixed sound.  (You can disable it in prefs if you want.)
  * Fixed bug to allow ships to enter water sectors that are completely surrounded by land.  (Thanks thegeneral!)
  * When on the city tab, don't select a single unit in a city.  This will allow players to set waypoints for all cities.
  * Removed horizontal scrollbars from sector, unit, city, and plan tabs.
  * Fixed bug that didn't display ETA on city tab
  * Moved prefs from tab to menu bar
  * Added new "Supply" tab that will be used to review/manage supply in a future release.

Release 1.1.44
  * Cities now have waypoints.  To set a waypoint on a city, select the city and right click on the map where you
    want the waypoint to be.  Any unit with sufficient mobility in that city will automatically move to that waypoint
    when it is created or updated.
  * Ally waypoints do not affect units.  Waypoints do not affect units that already have move orders.

Release 1.1.43
  * Bases now produce technology!

  * When your ship is interdicted by enemy ships, your ship will no longer counter-attack.
  * When a ship attacks, all adjacent enemy ships will counter-attack irrespective of whether they're in supply.
  * Cruisers now do triple-damage against subs like destroyers
  * Cruisers are no longer considered capital ships (so they can no longer refuel helicopters)
  * Destroyers and cruisers are both considered to be escort ships
  * If an escort ship is within 2 sectors of a capital ship, then it will not move to interdict enemy ships.
  * The one exception to this is that a cruiser will move to interdict an enemy sub
  * Added "-" to mob column of units to indicate unit has a move order.
  * Made supply lines white again (were temporarily black by mistake)

Release 1.1.42
  * Fixed a bug that would cause the client to crash at startup sometimes.
  * Fixed a bug that would revive old unit move commands that had been cancelled when the server is restarted.

  * Building city no longer consumes engineer, but now requires engineer to be at full mobility.  Mobility is reduced to zero when new city is built.
  * Added new "switch terrain" action for engineers that allows them to switch water to land and vice-versa.  In order to build a new land
  sector, there must already be land adjacent.  Similarly for water.
  * Command point cost to switch terrain is 16
  * Mobility cost to switch terrain is 6
  * Added button to cancel move order on a unit
  * Replaced text buttons with icon buttons

Release 1.1.40
  * Changed heal from 1/2 hp for supplied/city to 20% / 40% of max hp (rounded down).
  * If, when you try to move a unit, that unit has insufficient mobility to move to the target sector, and that target sector
  would be reachable once the unit gained enough mobility, then the unit will be assigned an order to move to that sector.
  When the unit's mobility is updated and it has enough mobility to move to its target sector, it will move automatically
  at no command cost.
  * Allow players to disband multiple units at once
  * If X is at war with A and X is friendly to me, then if I ally with A, X should go neutral to me
  (because he can't trust me any more now that I've allied with his enemy)
  * Display ally tech level in Technology window
  * Fixed a bug that crashed client if you selected a game too quickly after starting up the client
  * World map size increased:  Length of world-map edges increased by approximately 50%.
  * World map percent water increased from 78% to 85%
  * World map distance between islands increased from 3 to 4

  * Command cost 4 to take a city
  * Command cost 10 to launch an icbm or satellite
  * Cities and units may now only be ceded to an ally.
  * To fix a cede abuse, changed relation change logic as follows:
When your relation with nation X changes (either instantly, or after a timer),
  then if your new relation with X is worse than neutral (i.e. WAR) then for each ally A of X:
  if A's relation to you is better than NEUTRAL it will be instantly reduced to NEUTRAL
  if your relation to A is better than NEUTRAL it will be instantly reduced to NEUTRAL
  

Release 1.1.38

Release 1.1.34
  * Include line of sight from ally units, cities and satellites.  (Note this means your allies satellites
    now appear under "Orbit" on your unit tab.)

  * Teams are now stored by score and nations by power on "Games" web page
  * Improved appearance of "Games" web page

Release 1.1.33
  * Implemented MAD.  Mutually Assured Destruction.  That means if you nuke an enemy city, that opponent(s) will automatically 
    counter-nuke their best enemy target.  There are no counter-counter nukes.
    The computer chooses the target based on what your opponent(s) can currently see.
    They will nuke the optimal target based on the following formula:
    sector score = total cost of all units in sector
    If the sector contains a player city, 48 is added to the score.
    The sector value is them multiplied by a relation modifier: ally/me = -2, friendly -1, neutral = 0, war = 2.
    The computer then chooses the target with the highest score.  (If the blast radius of the nuke > 0 then the score of all
    devastated targets is added together).  If a target is found with score >= 96 (i.e. at least 1 enemy city or the equivalent 
    of 48 hours worth of enemy units) then the counter-nuke is fired.  Note it is possible that a different enemy will be nuked
    from the one who fired the initial nuke:  "All is fair in love and war."
  * Fixed the Player tab so that the player list is visible on smaller resolutions.
  * Changed the way the menu works in the hopes it fixes the Mac menu problem (need to test)

  * Engineer units can now move onto water and build cities there!
  * Properly update unit count on the Units tab (a.k.a. "Ghost Engineer" bug)

Release 1.1.30
  * This is largely a bug-fix / stabilization release.  The most significant change for players is that I have fixed Issue #7,
    the "Early Bird" unit production bug that incorrectly started to build units in cities before the game started.  That should
    be fixed now.
  * Before shutting down, force flush of all data to prevent game corruption when the server is restarted.
  * Fixed Issue #2 TechEventUpdate SectorSeen update duplicate key value violates unique constraint "sectorseen_pkey"

    Points are displayed on the bottom right of the screen beside "CP:".
  * Command points replenish at a rate of cities + capitalShips + bases * 2 every 15 minutes to a maximum of 200.
  * Changed how supply works.  Supply ships and transports now carry ammo.  Their ammo is depleted when
    they resupply units within range.  If there is an unbroken supply chain from an attacking unit all
    the way back to a port, then the chain will remain fully supplied.  Once the chain is broken, supply
    will drain from the supply unit in the chain farthest from the attack backwards towards the attack.
    This preserves ammo near the front line where it is needed, but also where it will be vulnerable.
