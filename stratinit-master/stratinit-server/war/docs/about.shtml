<h1>About Us</h1>
<p><img src="../images/KenStevens.jpg" alt="Ken Stevens" width="200" height="208" align="left">Strategic Initiative is a free, Open-Source game created by me, Ken Stevens. I pay for the <a href="http://www.strategicinitiative.org">www.strategicinitiative.org</a> game servers out of my own pocket. I'm currently hosting the servers at <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">Rimu Hosting</a> which I highly recommend to anyone looking for a server hosting. The cost for me to run the servers is $55.29 per month.</p>
<p>If I ever end up getting so many players that I need to increase my server capacity, then I'll run a short donation campaign to raise the funds to pay for the increased capacity. But for now, I'm happy to pay for the servers myself.</p>
<p>The full source code for Strategic Initiative is available on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stratinit/">stratinit project</a> hosted by Google Code. Anyone is free to download the source code and host games on their own servers if they like.  The code is licensed under the   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" rel="nofollow">GNU General Public License v3</a>, so if you make improvements to the game I'd like to know about them so I can incorporate your changes back into the project (if they're good changes :-).</p>
<p>A bit about me... Back in the 90's, I was one of the key coders on an old, text-based online strategy game called <a href="http://www.wolfpackempire.com/history.html">Empire</a> which continues to live on to this day as <a href="http://www.wolfpackempire.com/">Wolfpack Empire</a>. Many of the ideas (supply, interdiction, interception...) in Strategic Initiative are drawn from this game. However Strategic Initiative is considerably simpler than Empire. Empire was the ultimate micro-management game.</p>
<p>I now work for a software consulting firm in Toronto, Canada, mostly as a Project Manager for software development projects. I don't get to code much at my day job, so for fun I write game software in my spare time.</p>
<p>I also create and publish board games, which you can check out over at <a href="www.toccatagames.com">Toccata Games</a>.</p>
