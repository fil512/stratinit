<H2>What is Strategic Initiative?</H2>
<P>
It's a game of strategic conquest and military tactics played over the course of 10 days.   See <A HREF="rules.shtml">Strategic Initiative Game Mechanics</A> for the detailed rules of the game.
</P>
<H2>How do I join a game?</H2>
<P>
Here is how you join a game:
</P>
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.strategicinitiative.org:8080/stratinit/register/Register.html">REGISTER</A>.  Note that when registering, you may get a blank page.  Press the "refresh" button in your browser to see the page.</LI>
<LI>Click on <A HREF="play.shtml">PLAY</A> and download the install file for your platform.  After the file has finished downloading,
double-click on it to run the program.  This will in-turn install the full client and run it.</LI>
<LI>In "Account Settings," enter the same username and password you registered with.</LI>
<LI>In the &quot;Join Game&quot; tab, click on a game in the list of games and click &quot;Join&quot;.</LI>
</OL>
<H2>Once I've joined, how do I play?</H2>
<OL>
<LI>In "Games," select the game you joined.</LI>
</OL>
<H2>OK I see the map, now what do I do?</H2>
<OL>
<LI>The map will be mostly greyed out because you haven't explored the world yet.</LI>
<LI>Right-click on the square on the map that looks like a radar station.  This will automatically select your starting zeppelin.</LI>
<LI>Left-click somewhere nearby on the map.  The zeppelin will move there, exploring nearby territory.  Look for white dots--these are cities you can conquer.</LI>
<LI>Once you find a neutral city, right-click on the square on the map that looks like a house.  4 infantry units will come up on the table on the right-hand part of your screen.</LI>
<LI>Click on one of the infantry units and then left-click on a neutral city.  Your infantry will march to the neutral city and capture it.</LI>
<LI>Now you have three cities!  Right-click on the new city and select "TRANSPORT" from the drop-down menu.  This will change your third city to a port and start building a transport ship.</LI>
<LI>Capture your fourth city and start building a "SUPPLY" ship there.</LI>
<LI>Wait until your transport is built (around a day depending on when the game started).  While you are waiting, explore with your zeppelin to find a second island.</LI>
<LI>Move your infantry onto the same square as the transport ship, and then select the transport ship to a new island, and move your infantry off the transport to capture cities on your second island.</LI>
</OL>
<H2>When I select a ship, the squares around it go light/dark blue.  What does that mean?</H2>
<P>Light squares are in supply and cost 1 to enter.  Dark squares are out of supply and cost 2 to enter.  See the "Supply" section of <A HREF="rules.shtml">Strategic Initiative Game Mechanics</A> for more details. For more details on how the user interface works, see the <A href="guide.html">Guide</A>.</P>

<H2>How do I make technology?</H2>
<P>The short answer is "Build Zeppelins or Engineers".  Technology is built by up to 4 Tech Centres (radar icon).  You turn a city into a Tech Centre by building a Zeppelin or Engineer in it.  See the "Technology" section of <A HREF="rules.shtml">Strategic Initiative Game Mechanics</A> for more details.</P>

<H2>What is the max move that a unit can save up?</H2>
<P>3 times the value of the "mob" column in the "Technology" window.</P>

<H2>How do I load units onto a transport ship?</H2>
<P>Just move the units into the square where the transport ship is.  Then when the transport ship moves, it will automatically carry the units with it.
To unload the units at the other end, just select them and move them where you want them to go.</P>

<H2>What purpose is a supply ship?</H2>
<P>Supply ships radiate supply 5 squares around them, making ships within that radius move faster.  For more details on supply, see the "Supply" section of <A HREF="rules.shtml">Strategic Initiative Game Mechanics</A>.</P>

<H2>How do I heal my units?</H2>
<P>Units in supply heal at a rate of 1 hp / 4 hours.  Units in a city heal 2 hp / 4 hours.</P>

<H2>When I moved, I got attacked.  What happened?</H2>
<P>You probably got interdicted or intercepted.  To learn about interdiction and interception, see <A HREF="rules.shtml">Strategic Initiative Game Mechanics.</A></P>

<H2>What do all the things in the interface do?</H2>
<P>For more details on how the user interface works, see the <A href="guide.html">Guide</A>.</P>

<h2>How come my fighters are only intercepting 3 sectors out?</h2>
<P>Interception is based on sectors you can see.  To intercept further out, build bases, tech centres, or station zeppelins near your airport so you can intercept enemy planes the full 5 squares out.</P>

<h2>How did a destroyer killed my infantry? I thought only battleships
  could attack land units.</h2>
<p>Any ship can attack land units in cities.</p>
