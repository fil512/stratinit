			<p>
				Player Rank is the weighted average of a player's
				<a wicket:id="TeamRankPage2">Team Ranks</a>.
				Rank is weighted by number of opponent teams played against
				for each team.  In the case of solo teams (where the player did not have an ally),
				only wins are counted when calculating the weighted average.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original
				<a wicket:id="LeaderBoardPage">Leader Board</a>
				is still available, although I consider the
				Elo ranking to be a
				better measurement of player skill as it takes into
				consideration the
				skill level of the players
				you beat.
