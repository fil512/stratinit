<h2>Leader Board</h2>
<span>
<p>
Player Rank is the weighted average of their <a wicket:id="TeamRankPage2">Team Ranks</a> (weighted by number of games
played on each team).  The original <a wicket:id="LeaderBoardPage">Leader Board</a> is still available, although I consider the
Elo ranking to be a better measurement of player skill as it takes into consideration the skill level of the players
you beat.
