repeat for 3 other platforms
document upgrade process:
1) update version in General Settings tab of install4j
2) Run build
3) Hand-edit update.xml, replace "installer.exe" xml attribute with "installer_partial.exe" (with same id) and remove _partial line.
4) Upload partial and update.xml to /home/stratinit/htdocs/install on server



* replace autowired -> autowired private
* reduce visibility of ui getters
* more variety in island types
* Make autowired fields final and add them to an autowired constructor
* When switching to unittab, rebuild if dirty
* get dijkstra on a repository somewhere (e.g. stratinit but preferably elsewhere)
